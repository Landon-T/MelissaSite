####Hi, I’m Melissa! 
####As a kid I dreamed of going to the Olympics.

Maybe that sounds cliché. But scribbled on the 5th page of my grade 8 journal (the first of what now is a 20+ volume series of thoughts, prayers, musings and doodles captured in pen and ink) is a giddy prayer about my audacious dream to one day compete at the prestigious Olympic Games. 
Don’t ask me when and where that dream exactly started. I don’t remember.
But by the time I had reached the 8th grade it was there, familiar, deeply ingrained, and already tainted with a grown-up understanding of probability such that in my journal I referred to it as my “silly dream”.
It wasn’t logical (dreams rarely are). And I had no idea where or how or if I could do it. 
But more than anything, deep in my heart I wanted to compete at the Olympic level
...and more than that, I wanted to use that experience to empower others.
