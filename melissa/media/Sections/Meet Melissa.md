# Hi, I’m Melissa! 
## As a kid I dreamed of going to the Olympics.

Maybe that sounds cliché. But scribbled on the 5th page of my grade 8 journal (the first of what now is a 20+ volume series of thoughts, prayers, musings and doodles captured in pen and ink) is a giddy prayer about my audacious dream to one day compete at the prestigious Olympic Games. 
Don’t ask me when and where that dream exactly started. I don’t remember.
But by the time I had reached the 8th grade it was there, familiar, deeply ingrained, and already tainted with a grown-up understanding of probability such that in my journal I referred to it as my “silly dream”.
It wasn’t logical (dreams rarely are). And I had no idea where or how or if I could do it. 
But more than anything, deep in my heart I wanted to compete at the Olympic level
...and more than that, I wanted to use that experience to empower others.

# THANK GOD IM A COUTRY GIRL
### I was raised on the family farm - homesteaded by my great-great-grandfather in 1932
Helping and playing on the farm provided me with endless learning opportunities, unique experiences and a strong foundation for athletic strength and coordination. Yet, more than hands-on skills and knowledge, the farm taught me many lessons that still guide me today: As my family cultivated, planted, cared for and harvested crops year after year through the ups and downs of abundance, drought, pests, market swings and weather both good and bad I learned about the value of hard work, the payoff of perseverance, the importance of integrity, the relationship between risk and reward, the power of perspective and so much more!
