LIFE AS AN ADVENTURE    
I see life as an adventure - like a hike that we kind of have a road map for but truth be told we are all figuring out along the way. For me, God is my adventure guide leading me, pointing out the path to take, encouraging me, challenging me and inviting me to step out and up along the way. Sometimes there are tough climbs. Sometimes we must go down before we can go up. Sometimes we get to enjoy the most wonderful and rewarding views along the way. Regardless, there is so much to take in and experience and learn along the way, and we are only better for the journey!
